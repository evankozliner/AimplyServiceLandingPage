            <article>
                <span class="q"><b>How does Aimply charge?</b><img class="qarrow" src="arrowExpand.svg"></span>
                <p class="a">Aimply bills per hour and on attributable growth or sales on a case-by-case basis. Low-skill services like video posting are around 15$ per hour. For any content we generate, we also charge based on growth and sales (in the 10-20% range) as well as an hourly base fee depending on the type of content being generated.</p>

                <p class="a">
                1. Research assistance: This can either be through our automated tools, or from a dedicated virtual assistant with a bachelor's degree.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                2. Video editing and posting: We can edit short or long form videos to add effects, B-roll, photos, etc. We also cut long form content to short form content for platforms like Tiktok. We're also happy to post videos onto platforms manually to avoid penalties for auto-posted content.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                3. AI content generation: We can generate tweets, blog posts, ebooks, all in your voice and tone. All content is generated based off your already-existing content; e.g. we can generate tweets using what you've said in your Youtube videos. We do not try to create "novel" content with AI.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                4. Community management: We can manage and set up Discord servers, Patreon accounts. We can act as moderators and handle responding to subscriber's questions. We'll remind your subscribers of your Q&As, keep your Discord "warm", and much more.

                <span class="q"><b>Why use Aimply over hiring virtual assistants from within my community?</b><img class="qarrow" src="arrowExpand.svg"></span>
                <p class="a">Hiring within your community can be great, but oftentimes it leads to working with less experienced employees who need rehired or let go frequently due to low hours and lack of upward mobility. At Aimply we work to ensure even our most junior employees have experienced supervision and appropriate weekly hours; this increases quality and reduces churn.</p>

                <p class="a">Unlike platforms like Upwork, we can be hooked into all aspects of your content, from research to content production and community management. Because we have such a holistic view of your content and your community, we can produce higher quality work.</p>

                <p>Hi there,</p>
                <p>I'm Evan, the CEO of Aimply.</p>
                <p>If you‚Äôre growing as a content creator, you‚Äôve probably thought about hiring an assistant from within your community or on a platform like Upwork. Here‚Äôs what makes us different:</p>
                <p>1. Creator-centric: Because we‚Äôre focused solely on the content creation market, we bring a depth of knowledge and research on what works to the table. This lets us offer you end-to-end solutions. Want to offer your subscribers an ebook with a discussion community and Q&A? We‚Äôll help write your ebook, and cover the community management.</p>
                <p>2. Automation expertise: We can offer you the best prices and fastest turnaround time possible on common tasks like research and generating short form content. We can also build custom automation solutions.</p>
                <p>3. Growth-oriented: Because our pricing is tied to our impact on your growth, our incentives are aligned with yours. We want to be your long-term partner and for our relationship to outlive the one you‚Äôd have with a single contractor.</p>
                <p>You‚Äôve got enough platforms to produce content for already. Book a call to work with a company you can produce content <i>with</i> instead.</p>
